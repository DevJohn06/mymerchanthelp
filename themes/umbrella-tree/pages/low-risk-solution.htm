                    What is a Low-Risk Payments Processing Solution?
                </h1>
                <p class="__content-text">
                    If you are doing business online, your capability to process client payments is one of the keys to
                    your
                    stability and continuity. However, your ability to do so immediately and safely is fundamental to
                    your
                    success. This is where your payment processors can come to the rescue, hooking you up with an online
                    merchant account. With its help and through a good-old payment gateway, you shall forever lounge in
                    the
                    generosity of your paying customers.
                    <br><br>
                    In the world of payment processing, there are low-risk merchants, medium-risk merchants, and
                    high-risk
                    merchants. Risk level is determined on a variety of business factors, such as processing history,
                    country of incorporation, and more.
                    <br><br>
                    Merchants classified as “low risk, will typically have all of the following characteristics: low to
                    mid-ticket sales, in an industry with a history of low chargebacks and in an industry that is not
                    politically controversial and is not highly regulated. A brick-and-mortar coffee shop, a bookstore,
                    or a
                    restaurant would be a typical example of a low-risk merchant.
                    <br><br>
                    Lower the risk, lower the rate of chargebacks. Here at Synergy Pay Solutions, we’re built to transact across
                    channels,
