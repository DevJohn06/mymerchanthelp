                        Before being able to accept payments online or with credit cards, you have to have a merchant account first. Merchants accounts are simply divided into two categories: low-risk and high-risk. Low-risk businesses are easily accepted by almost all banks and offer them their services. But for high risk merchants, that is not the case. Many payment processors do not want to process their electronic payments since they are identified with more unconventional processing agreements and are faced with the prospect of high charge backs. Thus this results in higher processing fees which are closely related to their risk factor. 
                        </br></br>
                        With the expectations for High Risk merchants to have chargeback fees, payment processors covering a rolling reserve to the merchant account is commonly practiced. This reserve then will be used by the acquiring bank to offset these expected chargebacks. Due to the merchant's unforeseen behavior, the reserve serves as the bank's additional layer of protection against this volatility.
